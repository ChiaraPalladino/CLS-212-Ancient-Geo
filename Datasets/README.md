This repository contains some georeferenced data from ancient sources, in CSV format. Most data comes from manually and semi-automatically annotated sources on Recogito (https://recogito.pelagios.org/), or from other DH projects, when otherwise specified. Information and credits are specified here. 

* [Strabo_description-of-crete](https://github.com/ChiaraPalladino/CLS-212-Fall2020/blob/master/Datasets/strabo_description-of-crete.csv): contains a full georeferenced dataset of Strabo's description of the island of Crete (Geography 10.4.1-10.4.22, original text in English [here](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239%3Abook%3D10%3Achapter%3D4%3Asection%3D1)). The dataset contains the original Ancient Greek place names, translated names in English, tags with place types from the Pleiades Gazetteer and manually added tags based on the original text. 

* [agathemerus_sketch-of-geography](https://github.com/ChiaraPalladino/CLS-212-Fall2020/blob/master/Datasets/agathemerus_sketch-of-geography.csv): This is a little project I did for my PhD (http://www.digitalagathemerus.org/). Agathemerus of Orthon is the author of a scholarly "Sketch of Geography", a very brief summary of information about ancient Geography and knowledge of the inhabited world. The dataset contains place type information from the Pleiades gazetteer, and manually classified tags indicating more precise categories (e.g. natural feature types, man-made structures, etc.). The text in English, aligned against the original Ancient Greek, is [here](http://ugarit.ialigner.com/userProfile.php?userid=3&tgid=321).

The dataset contains place types according to the Pleiades gazetteer, and manually added tags indicating a few other categories (mostly ethnics and regions). All entries are also classified by book number.

Places are tagged according to type and book number. The dataset is curated by Elton Barker (Open University), for the Digital Periegesis project (https://www.periegesis.org/). Place types are classified according to the Pleiades gazetteer, manually added tags provide further specification into man-made structures, types of land, corresponding ancient Greek categorizations.

* [Itinerarium Burdigalense](https://github.com/ChiaraPalladino/CLS-212-Fall2020/blob/master/Datasets/itinerarium-burdigalense.csv): work by the Anonymous Pilgrim of Bordeaux, it is the earliest description left by a Christian traveler in the Holy Land. The date of the journey is 333 CE. The name  of  the  author  is  not  known  to  us,  but  it  is  generally assumed  that  the  author  was  a  native  of  Bordeaux  (France), because the itinerary starts from there. The full text in English translation by Andrew S. Jacobs is available here (http://andrewjacobs.org/translations/bordeaux.html).
