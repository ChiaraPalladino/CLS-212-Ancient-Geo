* Strabo-Crete: contains a full georeferenced dataset of Strabo's description of the island of Crete (Geography 10.4.1-10.4.22, original text in English [here](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239%3Abook%3D10%3Achapter%3D4%3Asection%3D1)). The dataset contains the original Ancient Greek place names, translated names in English, tags with place types from the Pleiades Gazetteer and manually added tags based on the original text. 

* Agathemerus-data: This is a little project I did for my PhD (http://www.digitalagathemerus.org/). Agathemerus of Orthon is the author of a scholarly "Sketch of Geography", a very brief summary of information about ancient Geography and knowledge of the inhabited world. The dataset contains place type information from the Pleiades gazetteer, and manually classified tags indicating more precise categories (e.g. natural feature types, man-made structures, etc.). The text in English, aligned against the original Ancient Greek, is [here](http://ugarit.ialigner.com/userProfile.php?userid=3&tgid=321). 

* Herodotus_histories: This is the full georeferenced dataset of all places and ethnonyms mentioned in Herodotus' Histories (5th century BCE), annotated and georeferenced by Elton Barker (Open University). The dataset contains place types according to the Pleiades gazetteer, and manually added tags indicating a few other categories (mostly ethnics and regions). All entries are also classified by book number.

* Pausanias: This is the full georeferenced dataset of all places mentioned in Pausanias' Tour Guide of Greece (2nd century CE), an amazing description of the "touristic" areas in all Greece at the time of the Romans. Places are tagged according to type and book number. The dataset is curated by Elton Barker (Open University), for the Digital Periegesis project (https://www.periegesis.org/). Place types are classified according to the Pleiades gazetteer, manually added tags provide further specification into man-made structures, types of land, corresponding ancient Greek categorizations.

* Itinerarium Burdigalense: work by the Anonymous Pilgrim of Bordeaux, it is the earliest description left by a Christian traveler in the Holy Land. The date of the journey is 333 CE. The name  of  the  author  is  not  known  to  us,  but  it  is  generally assumed  that  the  author  was  a  native  of  Bordeaux  (France), because the itinerary starts from there. The full text in English translation by Andrew S. Jacobs is available here (http://andrewjacobs.org/translations/bordeaux.html). 

* Homer, Catalog of Ships: a fully georeferenced Catalog of Ships, with place names in English and tags for ethnics, commanders, number of ships, and number of soldiers.
