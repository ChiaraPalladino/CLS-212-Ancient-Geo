* Strabo-Crete: contains a full georeferenced dataset of Strabo's description of the island of Crete (Geography 10.4.1-10.4.22, original text in English here). The dataset contains the original Ancient Greek place names, translated names in English, tags with place types from the Pleiades Gazetteer and manually added tags based on the original text. 

* Agathemerus-data: This is a little project I did for my PhD. Agathemerus of Orthon is the author of a scholarly "Sketch of Geography", a very brief summary of information about ancient Geography and knowledge of the inhabited world. The original text in English is here. 

* Herodotus_histories: This is the full georeferenced dataset of all places mentioned in Herodotus' Histories (5th century BCE), annotated and georeferenced by Elton Barker (Open University). The dataset contains place types and manually added tags indicating ethnics, and it also indicated the book where each place name occurs. 

* Pausanias: This is the full georeferenced dataset of all places mentioned in Pausanias' Tour Guide of Greece (2nd century CE), an amazing description of the "touristic" areas in all Greece at the time of the Romans. Places are tagged according to type and book number. The dataset is curated by Elton Barker (Open University), for the Digital Periegesis project (link).
