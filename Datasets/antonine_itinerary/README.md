### Antonine Itinerary

The Antonine Itinerary is the largest list of places and distances surviving from ancient Rome. The Itinerary survives from 7th-10th century medieval manuscripts, and the author is unknown. It is structured in a terrestrial and a maritime portion. 

The itinerary is a large compilation of imperial routes, and it is the most important textual document about the Roman road network. Plotting this itinerary in a GIS software means being able to reconstruct almost all the evidence we have about ancient Roman roads. 

The structure of the terrestrial itinerary is very simple: each line contains a place name and the distance to it from the previous stage, in Roman miles or leagues. The terrestrial portion is further divided into geographical areas, e.g. Africa, Italy, Macedonia, Gallia, and so on. 

This data comes from my private research, and it will not be available anymore after the end of the course. Feel free to play with it, and see what insights you can get.
