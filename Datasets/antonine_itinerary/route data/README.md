### Route data from the Antonine Itinerary

These files will support simple route data visualizations using the Points2One plugin in QGIS. 

* Files marked _locationsonly.csv contain the same itinerary division as in the main folder, but all places with no location have been stripped. They contain two types of routes: main routes and simple ones. 
* Files marked _routes_locationsonly.csv contain only the simple routes, with no unknown locations. They are ideal for conversion into lines. 
* Files marked _mainroutes_locationsonly.csv contain the main routes, which will display as very long lines. They can be useful to see the bigger picture.
